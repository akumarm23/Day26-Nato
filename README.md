## Overview

This Python script, `main.py`, utilizes the NATO phonetic alphabet to convert a word entered by the user into its corresponding phonetic code words. The script reads the NATO phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file and creates a dictionary to map each letter to its phonetic code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- `pandas` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akumarm23/Day26-Nato.git
   cd Day26-Nato
   ```

2. Install the required library:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Files and Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main Python script for converting words to NATO phonetic code.
- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`: CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet data.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a word when prompted.
3. The script will output the NATO phonetic code words for the entered word.
